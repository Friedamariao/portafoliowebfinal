                Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)<br>
                With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)<br>
                I slept all alone (Uh-huh)<br>
                You still wouldn't go<br>

                Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later<br>
                I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters<br>
                You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor<br>
                You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby<br>

                Was it over when she laid down on your couch?<br>
                Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?<br>
                "Come here," I whispered in your ear<br>
                In your dream as you passed out, baby<br>
                Was it over then? And is it over now?<br>

                When you lost control (Uh-huh)<br>
                Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)<br>
                Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)<br>
                Your new girl is my clone<br>

                There were flashin' lights<br>
                At least I had the decency<br>
                To keep my nights out of sight<br>
                Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs<br>
                And my whispered sighs<br>
                Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'<br>
                Off of very tall somethings<br>
                Just to see you come runnin'<br>

                If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)<br>
                You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)<br>
