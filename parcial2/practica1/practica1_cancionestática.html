    (Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)<br>
        With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)<br>
        I slept all alone (Uh-huh)<br>
        You still wouldn't go<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later<br>
        I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters<br>
        You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor<br>
        You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Was it over when she laid down on your couch?<br>
        Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?<br>
        "Come here," I whispered in your ear<br>
        In your dream as you passed out, baby<br>
        Was it over then? And is it over now?<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        (Is it? Is it? Is it?)<br>
        Wh–µn you lost control (Uh-huh)<br>
        Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)<br>
        Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)<br>
        Your new girl is my clone<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        And did you think I didn't see you?<br>
        There were flashin' lights<br>
        At least I had the decency<br>
        To keep my nights out of sight<br>
        Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs<br>
        And my whispered sighs<br>
        Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'<br>
        Off of very tall somethings<br>
        Just to see you come runnin'<br>
        And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)<br>
        If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)<br>
        You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)<br>
        You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby<br>
        </p>

    <p>
        Was it over when she laid down on your couch?<br>
        Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?<br>
        "Come here," I whispered in your ear<br>
        In your dream as you passed out, baby<br>
        Was it over then? And is it over now?<br>

        Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'<br>
        Off of very tall somethings<br>
        Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')<br>
        And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        (Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)<br>
        Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)<br>
        (Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there<br>
        And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)<br>
        I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)<br>
        But no<br>
        (Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)<br>
